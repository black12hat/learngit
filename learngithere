firstly intialize the git the working directory command:"git init"
git status- it tells about the files which are in the staging area and are in non staging area so if a file is in red color that the file is in the non staging area
so basically any file in working can be in two stages
firstly in the non staging area which means the file is in working directory but not in the staging area 
another is in the staging area
so if a file is in staging area then it is ready to commit
git add "file name" : it adds the file to the staging area
git add . : this add all files in the working directory to the staging area 
git commit -m "message" : This one is used to commit the changes in the file , in message we write the changes made to the file
git log : it tells about the actions made on the file
